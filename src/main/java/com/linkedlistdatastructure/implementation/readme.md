### Details

* In this folder i added all the implementations regarding the different types of linked lists.
* I created a interface called _LinkedListDataStructure_ that will contain all the main operations
  from linked lists
* Each type of linked list will implement this interface
* The _Node_ class will be used in all implementations as well.
* There are tests for each linked list type in the _src/test/java/implementation_ with the commom
  operations
  implemented.
